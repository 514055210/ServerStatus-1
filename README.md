Server Status 3 BETA
============
Welcome to the Server Status 3 Beta! The main goal of the beta is to make sure that there are no major issues found and to squeeze any more features before release.

Installation
============
Installation of Server Status 3 requires more setup than the previous version, if you want to utilize server uptime monitoring.

Installation instructions can be found on the PiLabs Website at https://www.pilabs.io/forum/index.php?threads/installation.51/

What's Changed?
============
The biggest thing that has changed is that Server Status 3 no longer requires a mySQL database, as it is now stored in the configuration file.

Some additional features are:
* Cached Data
* New Theme
* Easier to create custom themes
* Uptime monitoring
* Downtime History
* New default theme
* Additional Ping Status theme, for showing weekly uptime data.
