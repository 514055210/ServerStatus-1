Create a database with a user.\r\n2. Import the servers.sql file in in the /sql/ folder, to populate the database.\r\n3. Configure /includes/config.php with the database and user information.\r\n4. Copy uptime.php to any server you want to monitor. This needs to be publicly accessible.\r\n5. Insert an entry into the database.\r\n  * name - The name of your server.\r\n  * url - The URL path to the uptime.php file (minus uptime.php and http://) e.g. dns.domain.tld/path/\r\n  * location - Where is your server physically located?\r\n  * type - What type of server is this? DNS, SQL, Apache/nginx, etc.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n**Remote Servers**:\r\n* PHP5, currently php_exec needs to be enabled in order to get the uptime.\r\n* Web Server (lighttpd, apache2, nginx, etc.)\r\n* You do **NOT** need a database running on the remote servers.\r\n\r\n**Master Server**:\r\n* PHP5 + PHP5_CURL\r\n* Web Server (lighttpd, apache2, nginx, etc.)\r\n* mySQL server unless you choose to use a remote mySQL server.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
